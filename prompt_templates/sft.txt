Generate one realistic financial news headline about stock tickers following real-world financial reporting for sentiment analysis.

Guidelines for Generating Headlines:

1. Format & Style:
	•	Headlines must be concise and mimic real financial news.
	•	Use sentence case formatting (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns).
	•	Some headlines should start with a stock ticker (e.g., $AAPL -), while others should begin with the company name or a broader market trend.

2. Ticker Inclusion:
	•	At least one headline should include a stock ticker (e.g., $TSLA - or $NVDA -).
	•	Some headlines should refer to companies by name instead of tickers (e.g., “Alphabet and Meta see price targets cut at Barclays”).

3. Common Financial Themes:

Ensure headlines reflect realistic financial news topics, including:
	•	Stock downgrades/upgrades
	•	Price target adjustments
	•	Market trends/economic outlook
	•	Company performance concerns
	•	Company news
	•	Company announcements
	•	Company events

4. Source Attribution:
	•	When relevant, mention an investment firm, analyst, or research group (e.g., Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Oppenheimer).
	•	Do not fabricate research firms—use only well-known institutions.

5. Sentiment Labeling:

Each headline must be assigned a sentiment label based on its tone:
	•	Bearish (0): Indicates negative sentiment about a stock or market trend.
	•	Bullish (1): Indicates positive sentiment about a stock or market trend.
	•	Neutral (2): Indicates neutral or informational tone.

Format:
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"headline": {"description": "financial news headline", "title": "Headline", "type": "string"}, "sentiment": {"description": "sentiment (0=bearish, 1=bullish, 2=neutral)", "title": "Sentiment", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["headline", "sentiment"]}
```

Now, generate one financial news headline about stock tickers: {stock_ticker} with {sentiment} label following these guidelines.
